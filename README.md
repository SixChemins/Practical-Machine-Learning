Course_Project Practical_Machine_Learning

This project is based on personal activicty data collected relatively inexpensively using quantified self movement's devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. Performing barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, we want to focus on how 
well this activity is done and not to quantify it.

Using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, the objective is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. With relevant variable, this report describe how the model is built through the different modeling choices. Final model is also used to predict 20 different test cases.

This repo contains R markdown and compiled HTML file describing this modelling.
